Screening of Nanobodies against SARS-Cov-2 and Identification of Active Residues
# Description
 Nanobodies, also known as VHHs or Nbs, are single-domain antibodies derived from camelid heavy-chain antibodies. Nanobodies have many unique properties that make them good candidates for the treatment of viruses. However，there is a lack of in silico screening techniques to promptly identify a large number of nanobodies. Three-steps screening strategy iteratively in Silico was used to acquire effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 nanobodies. Among the strategy，we use NeighborSearch to identify the active residues of nanobodies and antigen. The program can directly output the IDs of the active residues.
