# SARS-COV-nanobody-screening
Screening of Nanobodies against SARS-CoV-2 and Identification of Active Residues
# Description
Nanobodies, also known as VHHs or Nbs, are single-domain antibodies derived from camelid heavy-chain antibodies. Nanobodies have many unique properties that make them good candidates for the treatment of viruses. However，there is a lack of in silico screening techniques to promptly identify a large number of nanobodies. Three-steps screening strategy iteratively in Silico was used to acquire effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 nanobodies. Among the strategy，we use NeighborSearch to identify the active residues of nanobodies and antigen. The program can directly output the IDs of the active residues.
# Usage
  ## Download Data
   The required data can be downloaded from the respective database:
      *'8GZ5' is the PDBID，it can be replaced with other anti-SARS-Cov-2 nanobodies. Please note that the ID needs to be capitalized when downloading using the following link.
   
       · Download the sample PDB file: http://www.nanolas.cloud/download/pdb/8GZ5.pdb   

   
   
  ## Identify Active Residues
   Download the code: 
   
      · Identify Active Residues/toparquest.py
      
   Make sure to put **toparquest.py** and **8gz5.pdb** in the same directory.
